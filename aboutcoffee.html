        <p>About Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
        When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and
        dried. Dried coffee seeds are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and
        then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.
        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine
        content.It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g.,
        espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or
        iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste.</p>
