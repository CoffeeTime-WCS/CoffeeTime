                        <p>Coffea arabica , also known as the Arabian coffee, "coffee shrub of Arabia", "mountain coffee" or "arabica
                            coffee", is a species of Coffea. It is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, and is the
                            dominant
                            cultivar, representing about 60% of global production.This top-notch arabica coffee is so palatable; It has a
                            subtle,
                            softer,and sweeter flavor. When roasted, there is a note of perfumey smell with a fruity, sugary tone in the
                            berries.
                            Compared to Robusta, Arabica tends to have more acidity, less caffeine, and smoother taste. However, the distinctive
                            flavor of Arabica coffee might change when it is brewed cold or with crema.</p>

                        <p>Robusta is the second most-produced coffee bean in the world. Robusta plants are naturally immune to the disease. It
                            is double the amount of caffeine that makes itself very protective, and it can also grow in low or high altitudes.
                            However, high-quality Robusta beans come from the plants cultivated in the hot climate and receive irregular
                            rainfall. Robusta coffees are mainly grown in Africa and Indonesia. Robusta has a delicate, sharp taste, often
                            bitter and harsher, so adding cream or sugar does not alter the taste. It contains high caffeine and less sugar and
                            thus making it perfect for espresso. There can also be found high-quality Robusta that has low caffeine and a slight
                            note of chocolate flavor</p>

                        <p>Excelsa coffee plant is now considered to be the species of the Liberica family. Though, there is a far difference
                            between them. These types are primarily like Liberia beans- mostly almond-like shaped but have an average size, some
                            of them get larger scale though. Excelsa plants are mainly found in Southeast Asia, and the beans are mostly used as
                            blending coffee.Excelsa has a unique taste profile, somewhat mysterious; it has a flavor of both light roast and
                            dark roast coffeeâ€”feels like tart, fruity, and somehow dark. It is the distinct flavor that persuades coffee
                            enthusiasts to seek and try this drink from around the world.</p>

                        <p>Liberica coffee beans are much larger than the more popular arabica and robusta beans.Due to its rareness and limited
                            supply on a global level, the cost of regular liberica beans are on the higher end with premium liberica beans
                            carrying a heavier price tag. This type of coffee has an exceptional taste profile. Liberica is said to have a
                            woody, nutty flavor, with a smoky note in its full body with a floral, fruity aroma. It might be unpleasant to the
                            palate,but it is still amazing to some folks for its bold, dark flavor.</p>
