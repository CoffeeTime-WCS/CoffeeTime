                    <p>Coffea arabica , also known as the Arabian coffee, "coffee shrub of Arabia", "mountain coffee" or "arabica
                    coffee", is a species of Coffea. It is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, and is the dominant
                    cultivar, representing about 60% of global production.This top-notch arabica coffee is so palatable; It has a subtle,
                    softer,and sweeter flavor. When roasted, there is a note of perfumey smell with a fruity, sugary tone in the berries.
                    Compared to Robusta, Arabica tends to have more acidity, less caffeine, and smoother taste. However, the distinctive
                    flavor of Arabica coffee might change when it is brewed cold or with crema.</p>

                <p>Robusta is the second most-produced coffee bean in the world. Robusta plants are naturally immune to the disease. It is double the amount of caffeine that makes itself very protective, and it can also grow in low or high altitudes. However, high-quality Robusta beans come from the plants cultivated in the hot climate and receive irregular rainfall. Robusta coffees are mainly grown in Africa and Indonesia. Robusta has a delicate, sharp taste, often bitter and harsher, so adding cream or sugar does not alter the taste. It contains high caffeine and less sugar and thus making it perfect for espresso. There can also be found high-quality Robusta that has low caffeine and a slight note of chocolate flavor</p>

                    <p>Excelsa coffee plant is now considered to be the species of the Liberica family. Though, there is a far difference between them. These types are primarily like Liberia beans- mostly almond-like shaped but have an average size, some of them get larger scale though. Excelsa plants are mainly found in Southeast Asia, and the beans are mostly used as blending coffee.Excelsa has a unique taste profile, somewhat mysterious; it has a flavor of both light roast and dark roast coffeeâ€”feels like tart, fruity, and somehow dark. It is the distinct flavor that persuades coffee enthusiasts to seek and try this drink from around the world.</p>

                    <p>Liberica coffee beans are much larger than the more popular arabica and robusta beans.Due to its rareness and limited supply on a global level, the cost of regular liberica beans are on the higher end with premium liberica beans carrying a heavier price tag. This type of coffee has an exceptional taste profile. Liberica is said to have a woody, nutty flavor, with a smoky note in its full body with a floral, fruity aroma. It might be unpleasant to the palate,but it is still amazing to some folks for its bold, dark flavor.</p>
